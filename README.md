- My story......
- I am an art student graduating in mid 90's.
- I am 45 and didn't have internet in my school when I graduated.
- In the meantime the world has changed, computers have become the ruler of all things. 
- I am intelligent enough to learn coding and more internet commands, keyboard commands (I peck to type), and basic knowledge of hack. 
- That's why I bought a subscription to GitHub.com, so anyone willing to take the time to help me would be much appreciated.
- I can compinsate you in some way. 
- Maybe not with money, but conversation or company. 
- I'm a great friend.
